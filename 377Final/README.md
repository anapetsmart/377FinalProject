Tile of Project:

Pawe-some Puppies!

Target Browsers: The website was made in order to display on both mobile screens and desktop. It was created and tested on a Windows laptop, so it works best on newer Android systems. While it was created and tested on windows, it is still meant to be able to displayed on any system that supports HTML5, AND CSS3, this includes iOS systems.

API used:

I used the dog breed API. It included a list of dog breed names and sub-breeds, and photos of the different breeds.
Link to website with information on the API:

https://dog.ceo/dog-api/

Actual API linked in code:

https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all

Visualization:

The main visualization of my project is the list of dog breeds on the home page, with all of the names of the different breeds listed along with a picture next to the name. Users are able to filter this list using a text box by searching different dog breeds, and the breed and photo will show up. Users are also able filter this list alphabetically and reverse alphabetically. Some supplemental observations that my website also included were image carousels and a bar graph. 

Visualization and other JS Libraries:

My project uses chart.js to create the bar chart shown on the home page. It shows the breeds with sub breeds, and the bar height is measured by the amount of sub breeds that a certain breed has. In order to create the list of dog breeds shown on the home page, I made a request to the API and displayed the url given back next to the dog breed name.  

CSS Frameworks:

I used CSS3, which is the latest version. I did not use any specific CSS frameworks.

What my project is trying to display:

The main purpose of my project is to introduce people to different types of dog breeds. In order to do so, I wanted to use a lot of visuals to show people all of the different dog breeds. The problem that I am trying to solve is increasing dog adoptions. I wanted to help encourage people to adopt more dogs by showing them different dog breeds that they may have not heard of before. By offering the breed name, photo and amount of sub breeds that a breed has, I'm hoping that people will be encourages to look more into these breeds to see if adopting one would be right for them.
